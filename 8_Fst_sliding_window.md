# Analysis of introgression across the Makassar Strait

I'd like to calculate FST in a sliging window across the genome for comparisons between Borneo nemestrina and Sulawesi macaques and for comparisons between Borneo nemestrina and individual Sulawesi macaques, such as tonkeana, hecki, and maura.  Vcftools looks like the most straightforward way to do this.
